# PrimerProject

This is what I have so far.

The original plan was to make a cgi program that displays a header, blank space and a website on my website.

I have completed that portion of the assignment.

Then there is the portion that Professor Fitzgerald has assigned and that has not been accomplished.

I will continue cutting down this beast until it is done.

My program is located at http://www.csun.edu/~wsc10943/cgi-bin/simple.cgi
