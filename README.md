# PrimerProject

The original plan was to make a cgi program that displays a header, blank space and a website on my website.

I have completed that portion of the assignment.

Then there is the portion that Professor Fitzgerald has assigned.

I have gotten the query string, redirected homepage to program with errors included, and used external style sheets.

To my knowledge, the project is complete. But yet, my knowledge is limited so take it with a grain of salt.

My homepage is www.csun.edu/~wsc10943 and

the program is located at www.csun.edu/~wsc10943/cgi-bin/simple.cgi
