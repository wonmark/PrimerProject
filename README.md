# PrimerProject

The original plan was to make a cgi program that displays a header, blank space and a website on my website.

I have completed that portion of the assignment.

Then there is the portion that Professor Fitzgerald has assigned and that has not been accomplished.

What I have done is get the query string, redirect homepage to program, and use external style sheets.

I will continue to cut down this beast until it is done.

My homepage is www.csun.edu/~wsc10943 and

the program is located at www.csun.edu/~wsc10943/cgi-bin/simple.cgi
